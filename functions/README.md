## 8a_bots
Whether or not they intended this, 8a has created an API the public can hit. As the best part of 8a after ticking sendies is fucking with your friends - it seemed like a good idea to start playing with the API.

A climbing slack group I'm in (it's cooler than it sounds) was complaining about the feature drop the new 8a included. They took away XSS from us, and the more nefarious users (not me!) haven't figured out how to get it back. They also took away the ability to follow your friends (now reinstated). But, a week ago it wasn't there and a week ago I began the journey of writing the evil that is JS.

Anyway. This repo might end up holding other bots, but for now - it is just
